# Automated News Collection and Delivery System Using Web Scraping, WhatsApp Integration, and GitHub Actions


#### About
This project revolves around the development of an innovative system designed to automate the collection and delivery of the latest news from prominent news sources. Leveraging the power of web scraping, WhatsApp integration, and GitHub Actions, we have created a robust solution to tackle the challenges posed by the vast volume of online data and the increasing demand for real-time information.

Our system employs web scraping techniques to efficiently gather news articles from reputable sources like Estad√£o and CNN Brasil. It then integrates seamlessly with WhatsApp using a third-party API for automated news delivery to users. GitHub Actions orchestrates the entire workflow, ensuring timely execution of collection, processing, and delivery tasks at scheduled intervals throughout the day.

By optimizing the user experience, our system enables individuals to receive relevant news content quickly and effortlessly. It also addresses the issue of misinformation by delivering trustworthy news from reliable sources. Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the capabilities of web scraping and related technologies in enhancing the automated collection and delivery of information, ultimately improving information dissemination in our highly digitized society.
